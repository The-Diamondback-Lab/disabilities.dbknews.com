Jennifer Proctor feels stuck in a limbo between being a student and a worker. 

Proctor, a doctoral student in the information studies college, works as an instructor for an information science class at this university. As a student, she receives accommodations for her coursework through the University of Maryland's Accessibility and Disability Service. But she can't get similar accommodations for her job, because she's not considered a full-time faculty or staff member. 

"I was kind of in a black hole in that process because my student side had accommodations but as a student employee, my access to accommodations on the employee side is fairly limited," Proctor said. "So lots of students and student employees end up in this space where when you're TA-ing, you're kind of at the mercy of the instructor you're assigned to."

For Proctor and other student workers, navigating having a disability in their workplace can be complex. For some, the experience has been more positive. But systemically, they say things still need to change. 

This university's civil rights and sexual misconduct office offers resources on its website for community members seeking accommodations. Under a section of the site called "Reasonable Accommodations for Staff, Faculty and Student Employees," the accommodation request process is explained for staff and faculty — but not for student employees.

To Proctor, this omission on the website represents a larger culture where student employees are overlooked, stuck between students and full-time workers. 

In the past, she's had to make personal requests for accessibility in her campus job, like requesting that a class she was assigned to teach be moved to a different building because the original classroom did not have a chair for the instructor to sit in, she said. Such requests have been accommodated a couple times, Proctor said, but in other circumstances, she has been assigned to an administrative position in her department instead. 

"I spent one year where I was doing admin and advising instead of teaching because there just weren't any classes that I was qualified to teach and that were accessible to me, and there wasn't any goodwill to make those changes," Proctor said. 

Samuel DiBella, a doctoral student in the information studies college who works as a teaching assistant, has also faced difficulties with the accommodations process. 

DiBella has chronic depression, which runs in his family. After coming to this university, he sought out extended time accommodations for his coursework. However, this university’s Accessibility and Disability Service told him his medical documentation was outdated and the University Health Center said his disability did not meet the criteria to merit support via accommodations, he said.

His difficulties on the student side have been reflected in his campus job, too. He said navigating the university as a student worker with disabilities has been amplified by the demands of graduate school. 

"The stress of grad school and the immense amount of pressure and work that is asked of us, it kind of like across the board means that it's almost impossible for us to give our full attention and care to any individual job that we're doing," DiBella said. 
 
Laura DeMarco, a senior communication major at the University of Maryland at Shady Grove, has been a student library assistant at the campus' Priddy Library since last summer. For the most part, her experience as a student worker has been more positive. 

"There's a certain level of privilege that comes from having an invisible disability," DeMarco said. "I don't need mobility aids, I can talk reliably… I don't spend a lot of time in the hospital so I don't have to take a lot of time off work for my disability." 

DeMarco doesn’t use augmentative or alternative communication — a variety of  methods that can supplement communication for those with communication disorders — which also makes her experience with her disability less complex to navigate. 

Having supervisors who understand her experience has also helped create a welcoming environment at DeMarco's campus job, she said. DeMarco explained that one of her supervisors has the same disability that she does, and tends to hire others with similar disabilities, creating a space for empathy.

"If I was working for people who were not disabled… I'd have more trouble at work," she said. 

DeMarco gets accommodations for her classes and coursework through the Shady Grove campus' Disability Support Services. Like Proctor and DiBella, she doesn't have formal accommodations for her on-campus job. 

However, because one of her supervisors has the same disability as her, DeMarco said she can rely on them to be flexible if she ever approaches them because she needs an extension or another accommodation. 

For all students to have an equally positive experience working campus jobs, DeMarco said the culture surrounding approaches to disabilities needs to change — not just in the workplace, but systematically, too. 

"The onus is on the person facing discrimination to report it and go through the emotional labor of dealing with it, rather than focus being on the people in power not to discriminate," she said. "Anything UMD can do to change the narrative, at least on campus, that's what it is." 

DiBella, too, wants things to change not only at this university, but systemwide, so that all students with disabilities receive more support. 

"I wish that universities did not see their role as policing … who is allowed and who is deserving of support," DiBella said. "I think that we should rely on and listen to the experiences of people with disabilities and trust that they'll be able to determine for themselves."
