Despite legal attempts to provide equitable accommodations for people with disabilities, challenges persist due to gaps and exceptions in legislation.

The Americans with Disabilities Act, Fair Housing Act and similar federal laws prohibit discrimination and require accommodations for those with disabilities in various settings, from multifamily housing to public services. 

Alongside those laws, state and local protections mirror the same requirements against discrimination and for accommodations, sometimes providing further protections to groups not already covered by federal law. But those in the disability rights law and advocacy fields are still pushing to remedy gaps in those pieces of legislation. 

<h4>The Americans with Disabilities Act</h4>

The ADA, passed in 1990, has five titles, the first of which applies to employment. Employers are required to provide reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities, which can include providing a modified work schedule or assistive equipment. 

But if making accommodations puts an undue financial or administrative burden on employers, it's not required. 

These caveats in the law can pose barriers to some individuals seeking accommodations for employment, said Luciene Parsley, legal advocacy director at Disability Rights Maryland, a nonprofit law firm in Baltimore.

The onus for getting accommodations is often put on the employee rather than the employer, Parsley added, which means individuals who aren't familiar with the ins and outs of the ADA can face further difficulties. 

"Lots of people don't know about accommodations and how they apply in employment," Parsley said. "If someone has a disability and they're having difficulty doing their job, there is no affirmative requirement for the employer to ... tell them."

Titles II and III of the ADA also prohibit discrimination, in public services, such as government agencies, and businesses, such as restaurants and stores, respectively. Under these titles, reasonable accommodations and physical accessibility are required. 

Despite the ADA's provisions, there are still gaps. Certain entities, including religious entities and some government buildings are exempt from meeting some ADA requirements, Parsley said.

But federally funded entities are not entirely exempt from all disability-related laws. They may still be subject to requirements under other disability laws, such as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which prohibits discrimination against those with disabilities in programs that receive federal funding, and the Architectural Barriers Act, which requires accessibility in federally funded buildings.

<h4>The Fair Housing Act</h4>

The Fair Housing Act, which was amended to include protections for those with disabilities in 1988, is also a major piece of disability rights legislation. 

Under the Fair Housing Act, multifamily housing built after March 13, 1991, must be accessible. This can include elevators if there are stairs present, accessibility to every first floor and an accessible path of travel to any sidewalks present outside the dwelling.

If the multifamily housing is also fully or partially federally funded, it's subject to further requirements under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, such as accessibility in bathrooms and kitchens inside the dwelling.

Landlords do not have to make changes to make multifamily dwellings accessible if they were built before 1990, Parsley said, or if making changes presents an undue burden. Some modifications in multifamily housing may be allowed but not subsidized by landlords, which can also pose difficulties for those with disabilities. 

"There are some programs for low income people in a lot of jurisdictions that help people make modifications but overall, I would say that cost presents a barrier to a lot of people," Parsley said. 

Brian Gilmore, a senior lecturer in the University of Maryland's law and society program, practiced law for 28 years, primarily helping those with mental disorders and intellectual disabilities secure fair and equitable housing under the Fair Housing Act. According to Gilmore, many of the landlords he encountered were not familiar with the provisions of the act. Usually, the landlord’s lawyer is the one who has to explain the law and the need to provide accommodations, Gilmore said. 

When someone has a disability that is not necessarily visible — such as post-traumatic stress disorder or another mental disorder —  landlords are not as readily willing to provide them with accommodations under the Fair Housing Act, Gilmore said, often writing them off as simply exhibiting bad behavior.

He explained education is necessary to build further equity. 

"We need more education for the housing providers, and they would understand what's going on here, and also more education for the government officials who should be enforcing this more vigorously," Gilmore said.

<h4>Disability Laws in Prince George's County</h4>

While much disability and accessibility legislation occurs on the federal and state levels, the municipal stage has seen developments in recent years as well. 

In March 2019, the NAACP's Legal Defense and Educational Fund and other advocacy groups sent a letter to Prince George's County regarding the school system's high number of expulsions and suspensions, which it said disproportionately targeted students of color and students with disabilities.

Students with Individualized Education Plans accounted for 11 percent  of the county's student enrollment, but made up 24 percent of suspensions and expulsions, according to the letter. 

"The Maryland State Department of Education has repeatedly flagged PGCPS for the significant disproportionate use of discipline against students of color under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”) regulations, requiring the diversion of federal funding to Coordinated Early Intervention Services to correct and prevent such disparate treatment," the organizations wrote. 

The Legal and Educational Defense Fund and other groups called on the county to align its policies with Maryland and federal laws and strengthen resources for students with disabilities.  Prince George's County complies with the ADA, and has both a countywide ADA coordinator and coordinators for individual departments and agencies. 

"Despite these problems, we know that it is possible for the district to move forward in a positive and meaningful direction," the letter said. "We want to ensure that the district’s reform efforts effectively address the issues that continue to arise in our cases and in conversations with the community." 

Prince George’s County Public Schools did not respond to requests for comment on the letter. 

The county is also subject to Fair Housing Act requirements.  

Through municipal legislation that has been in effect since February 2020, Prince George's County prohibits discrimination in the housing industry based on source of income. 

The Fair Housing Act does not explicitly ban discrimination on the basis of income or social class. However, beyond observing the provisions of the federal statute, municipalities can offer further legal protections for those in other groups, including one based on a person's source of income. 

But Gilmore explained in places without such protections, the overlap found between those with disabilities and low-income individuals leads people trying to secure equitable housing to run into barriers. 

"We had a number of cases where the voucher was obtained because of a disability. And then the landlords didn't want to rent to the family because they had a voucher,” he said.  “So it was like a two edged sword, disability and voucher at the same time."
