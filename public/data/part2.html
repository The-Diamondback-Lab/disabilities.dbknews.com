After extensive research on academic accommodations, Maya Seitz was ecstatic when they found an option they believed would work for them. 

The junior psychology and music major has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and often feels overwhelmed by their workload. For them, the solution meant a reduced credit load to help manage their time. They would be able to take less than 12 credits while retaining full-time status and would keep their scholarship — it was perfect, they said. 

But after a misunderstanding with the University of Maryland's Accessibility and Disability Services Office, Seitz ultimately lost funding for not taking enough credits.

Seitz isn’t the only one who has had negative experiences with ADS — some students seeking accommodations say they had issues with communications with the office and timing of responses. 

Students are responsible for self-identifying to ADS, said Tessa Cahill, the interim director for ADS at this university. This means students must take the first step to apply to receive accommodations by filing a report, uploading documentation, and meeting with a disability specialist.

For students who might lack the necessary documentation that indicates a disability, such as an official diagnosis, ADS works with the Counseling Center and other diagnostic centers to help students acquire the resources they might need to take advantage of accommodations.

The process for receiving accommodations needs to be individualized because a disability can manifest in different ways, Counseling Center director Chetan Joshi noted. The accommodations are tailored to address the specific needs of each student, he said.

“Ultimately it comes down to the expression of the disability within that particular student,” he said.

The number of people seeking services with ADS is skyrocketing. Compared to last year, traffic in ADS is up about 20 percent, Joshi said.

Cahill attributes the drastic increase to a recent societal shift around what it means to have a disability. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, different types of populations — such as those with anxiety and depression —began to increasingly seek accommodations. 

The university is in the process of interviewing and hiring new staff for the ADS office, which has recently been struggling to keep up with demand, resulting in longer wait times, Joshi said.

“The hope is as we go through that cycle, as we bring more staff and expand the office … basically all of these wait times and some of these previous issues that have really gotten in the way of us being able to function as efficiently and as timely as we would want to, will really go away,” he said. 

Although ADS is working to improve its services, some students are still disappointed with their experiences. 

“I was pretty strongly led to believe when we started planning that my scholarship wouldn't be affected,” Seitz said. “I really thought about dropping out for a while because I felt like this was a pretty clear message to me about who is and isn't really welcome on college campuses.” 

Now, Seitz takes 12 credits to maintain their scholarship, and is having a hard time juggling their responsibilities, they said. They are constantly fatigued, sometimes even experiencing mouth ulcers due to stress.

“I really, really wish I just could have made the accommodation work out — and it's really upsetting to me that I couldn't,” they said.

Situations where a scholarship is at risk are rare, but course-load requirements could be a factor involved, according to a university statement.

Riya Sharma, a junior mechanical engineering and anthropology major, said she has had issues with testing accommodations. Sharma takes her exams separate from the rest of her class in a room with other students with accommodations. In that room, proctors monitor how much time each individual student has to complete their exam.

She said ADS only releases testing locations 10 hours prior to the start of an exam — another factor of stress in addition to waking up early and taking an exam, she said.

“It makes it really, really difficult to have to log onto the portal and check for that location on time,” she said. “Especially if that’s a building that you haven’t been to before, it’s sometimes difficult to locate as well.”

In one instance, Sharma had an exam in the Shoemaker building, where she’d never been before.

She got to that exam about 20 minutes late — when she arrived at the testing location, she found an empty classroom and spent 10 minutes searching for a proctor.

Sharma said she was okay with losing 10 minutes due to her tardiness but asked the ADS office about the other 10.

“They never gave me a straight response. They just said that they can’t give me more time,” Sharma said. “It was interesting because I wasn’t asking for more time, I was just asking for the time I already had.”

There is never a circumstance where a proctor would be late and permitted to take away the overall time allotted to a student as part of their accommodation, according to a university statement. 

ADS primarily helps with academic accommodations, Adith Thummalapalli said, noting some issues with physical accessibility, such as elevator maintenance, are simply out of their control. 

Many students’ frustrations with ADS stem from the length of the application process and the amount of documentation required to receive accommodations, Thummalapalli said. 

“The way it works is, you get what you asked for,” Thummalapalli, an alum member of the President’s Commission on Disability Issues, said. “So if a student goes in and doesn't really ask for much in the way of accommodations, just because they don't know what's out there, they're going to get very little.”

While the process of receiving accommodations was relatively straightforward for senior math major Cassidy Hankins, her experiences with professors have been frustrating.

“I have had professors … not really want to give me extensions,” she said. “It has been a little bit stressful at times just with certain professors.”

For the most part, faculty must implement accommodations as designated. But if a faculty has overarching concerns that an accommodation would “fundamentally alter a learning outcome,” they can work with ADS to provide an alternative accommodation for a student, Cahill said. 

And while the issue of lack of awareness needs to be resolved, there’s simply nobody in the ADS office to do it, Tumalapalli said. 

“A reason for that is they're pretty much always understaffed. They just don't have the staff they need to do these things like provide this information, create resources for students,” he said. “And that, again, comes back to budget.”

Looking back on the process, Seitz said she did not receive enough assistance from ADS, which was a huge barrier in terms of receiving accommodations.

“I often feel like in my experiences with ADS, that … appointments aren't about helping you mold your education to your needs,” they said. “You kind of have to prove to them that you're sick enough to deserve accommodations.”
