The elevator at Van Munching Hall is notorious for breaking down, said Charles Harry.

That causes little to no disruption for people without mobility impairments who need to go to the building’s third and fourth floor. But Harry, who uses a wheelchair, was once stranded for almost two hours, unable to leave the building due to a broken elevator.

University of Maryland staff did attempt to fix the elevator as quickly as possible, Harry said. But that incident is just one example of the reality many faculty and staff with disabilities on the campus face — there are still everyday challenges that the university hasn’t been able to address. The fault does not lie necessarily on one person or office, Harry said, but more so on a societal lack of understanding of disabled communities. 

“It’s really just … those little nuances that really can make a big difference to both students, and faculty and staff,” Harry said, who is a professor at this university with dual appointments in the school of public policy and the information studies college. 

Under the University of Maryland Disability and Accessibility Policy and Procedures, all students, faculty and staff have the right to ask for accommodations to their disabilities. Faculty members go through the Office of Faculty Affairs, while the University Human Resources focuses on staff accommodation, said John Bertot, associate provost for faculty affairs. 

The entire process may take a few weeks, Bertot said. But it depends on the nature of the disability and what the faculty member needs. Some accommodations may be temporary, such as in the case of a physical injury, while other cases may need to be revisited. 

A faculty member must file the accommodation request first through the University Human Resources, which does the initial assessment and determines whether the faculty member is eligible for reasonable accommodation, Bertot said. Then, they send the materials to the Office of Faculty Affairs.

Bertot then talks to the faculty member as well as reach out to their academic units. He might also talk to other departments, like Facilities Management, the Division of Information Technology and the Department of Transportation Services, to come up with an accommodation plan. 

The office uses a database that keeps track of the configuration of rooms so that faculty members are assigned an instructional space they can navigate.  Other possible accommodations include wireless microphones for those who are hearing impaired and accessible locking mechanisms. 

“We really have to understand the nature of [the accommodation], understand the space that the faculty member works in and understand their classroom needs in order to be able to make an appropriate accommodation,” Bertot said. 

For a staff member in the Facilities Management unit, certain aspects within the process for asking for accommodation both through the unit’s and university human resources were “problematic.” 

Alex, who agreed to talk with The Diamondback under a pseudonym, has a seizure disorder. They say their colleagues have been observant, quick to call 911 if they have a seizure at work. But the procedures the manager took were less than ideal for them — they asked for a fitness for duty evaluation due to their seizure disorder, which employers may do if they believe the seizures will impact a worker’s performance and safety. On another occasion, the manager submitted an incident report after Alex had a seizure, and did not notify them. 

“I felt that it became an assault on my integrity as an employee,” they said. “When it was [that] I had a medical condition and the occurrence happened at work.” 

Those actions made Alex feel like they couldn’t trust their managers, they said. The environment wasn’t hostile per se, they said, but they didn’t feel supported. They felt like there wasn’t a lot of empathy for their medical condition.  

When asking for COVID-19-related accommodations, they also found the process somewhat difficult. It felt like the staff from human resources didn’t fully understand Alex’s medical conditions and the impact they had on their work, they said, and were challenging the documentations at times.

Alex said ADA accommodations should be reviewed by a clinician or a nurse practitioner. Currently, only human resources and the faculty affairs office review the accommodation requests, according to Bertot.  

Seizure disorder is a hidden, invisible disability, Alex said. 

“It's an example of where a clinician should be involved in … reviewing the [accommodation] request,” they said.

Jennifer Proctor, a doctoral student in the information studies college, has reached out to her scheduling department in the past to request a classroom change. Proctor had been assigned to teach a data science class in the public health school, but the building did not have access to public transportation, she said. 

After she explained her disabilities, such as a fainting condition, asthma, and vertigo, that making the walking distance prohibitive, the university moved the classroom closer to the center of the campus, she said.

Proctor has had a mostly good experience when it comes to seeking accommodations at the university, she said. But there have been times where people have questioned her disability and her multi-purpose service dog, she said. She wishes people understood that many people can have more than one disability.

“​​I've learned to be a lot more graceful. I've learned a lot about the law, and being able to defend myself on those grounds,” Proctor said. “But there are periods of time where I just am so done with being harassed for bringing a service dog on public transit.” 

Harry has never formally asked for accommodation at this university, he said. Harry prefers to adapt himself, he said, calling himself “very stubborn in that way.”  He sometimes asks specific staff members to send him photos of the classrooms he will teach in advance, for example, or will ask his teaching assistant for help if the physical setting of the class prevents him from moving easily. 

Generally, he thinks the university does put some “good-faith effort” to try to push for more inclusivity and accessibility on the campus. There needs to be greater understanding of the reality of faculty and staff with disabilities, he said. 

“There's this entire system of interdependency that has to go right for us … to be able to do our tasks,” Harry said. 

When he navigates from one building to the other, it’s not as simple as the shortest, straightest path. He must think about the hills, which entrance is accessible for wheelchairs and what doors are automated.  

People without disabilities typically see accommodations as handicap accessible parking lots or doors, Harry said. 

“They’re wonderful, they’re necessary, but that’s really only just the tip of the iceberg,” Harry said.  

The university is generally very accommodating, he said. He doesn’t expect perfection — after all, he says, humans will never be perfect. What Harry calls on the campus community to understand is that the lack of accessibility can be very isolating so inclusivity is important. 

“Otherwise, we just kind of feel ignored, right?” he said. “We feel invisible.”
