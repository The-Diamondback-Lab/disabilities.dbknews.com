      <h1>About the Project</h1>
      <p>The Diamondback aimed to document the experience of individuals with disabilities at this university. Reporters spent months interviewing students, workers, and faculty with disabilities on campus, along with experts on disability and university officials in order to write these six stories.</p>
      <p>The Diamondback also acquired Accessibility and Disability Services documents and university budget data, working to shed light on the struggles that people with disabilities face on a daily basis, both on campus and off.</p>
