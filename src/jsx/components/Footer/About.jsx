      <h1>About the Project</h1>
      <p>To report this series, The Diamondback spent four months interviewing more than 100 people. Reporters used documents and interviews to examine the departments tasked with investigating sexual misconduct cases, the mental health resources available to those who experienced trauma and the educational initiatives in place to eradicate sexual assault.</p>
      <p>Reporters were determined to find out what circumstances compelled students to file cases with the U.S. Department of Education against this university for possible violations of Title IX, a federal anti-discrimination law.</p>
      <p className="notice">If youâ€™ve been affected by sexual assault and want to share your story, please contact The Diamondback at <a href="mailto:dbkinvestigations@gmail.com">dbkinvestigations@gmail.com</a></p>
